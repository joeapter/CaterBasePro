Place your stencil background PNGs in this folder so the PDF export can reference them.

Expected filenames (match the new ``document_background`` options):

- ``stencil-eucalyptus.png`` – Eucalyptus watercolor corners
- ``stencil-blush.png`` – Blush watercolor floral edges
- ``stencil-marble.png`` – Light grey marble texture
- ``stencil-botanical.png`` – Blush botanical parchment
- ``stencil-woodland.png`` – Rustic board + harvest scene

You can replace these with your own artwork as long as the filenames remain the same. After adding/changing files, rerun ``collectstatic`` (if in production) so Django can serve the new assets.
